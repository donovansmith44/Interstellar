ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is a game called Interstellar
which allows a player to go on a space expedition
on the search for habitable planets. You'll encounter
both friendly and hostile aliens who may help or impede
your ability to complete your mission. If you discover
that a planet is habitable on your mission, you can
send as many people as can be supported by the planet
to the planet. This is necessary, since Earth's ability
to support life has been decreasing following a series of
volcanic eruptions. It's up to you to find a suitable planet
and save humanity!
